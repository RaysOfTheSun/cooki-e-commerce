# cookie-commerce
`cooki-e-commerce` is a web app built using a bunch of web frameworks such as `react`, `node`, `expressJS` to sell a variety of cookies for an imaginary business with the name of "Cookie Stop".

# Set it Up
In case you want to play around with the project on your own machine, just follow the steps below:
* install the latest version of [`node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/).
* Install all the dependencies. This can be done by running `npm install` using your terminal.
* If desired, modify the paths and the port number used when hosting the app. All this stuff can be found in `server.js`.
* Once you're done with your edits, do run `npm run-script build` on your terminal to rebuild the bundle that the project uses to serve its styles and other assets.
* Start up the application by running `npm start` or `node server` using your terminal.
* To view the app, navigate to `localhost:[port number]/index` using your favorite web browser. Do take note that `port number` refers to the number you provided as a parameter for _listen(port,callback)_ found in __server.js__.
